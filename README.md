Remodeling houses to maximize the total selling price, with the constraint that the sum of the gross area of those houses is less than 20,000 square feet.

The approach to solve the given questions is with the help of Prescriptive Analytics (or Optimization).
This includes the below main concepts-
- Strategizing with Data – As the two fields Total value and Remodel for the first 20 houses are
empty in the sheet, we must strategize the data to get these values first. After getting these values
we can work on the data to get the answers. 
- Genetic Algorithm – Apply genetic algorithm to optimize the data to maximize the total selling
price of the house. It finds random solutions from the given input file and retains the best effective
solutions among them.
